    <h2>January 25th, 2023</h2>
    <p class="tab"> On Tuesday, we split up into teams to take notes about the ZMA walking tour and gain more information about the artworks in-person. There were many unexpected discoveries because the way that you interact with the sculptures and how they interact with the environment can only be seen in-person, which reinforces the enhanced experience a walking tour provides over a digital experience. </p>
    <p class="tab"> The <em>Marking Time</em> sculpture is meant to be a cairn, which is a pile of stones that act as a marker or burial monument. A possible reason that this sculpture is the first on the tour is that cairns act as markers that tell travelers they are going in the right direction. By taking a seat on the <em>Recess Swing</em>, I discovered that the swing is much larger than a normal swing, which makes one feel like they are the size of a child again when they sit in it. <em>Vandauga</em> was very difficult to find, and my team went into many buildings until we finally found it in the Wilson Annex. I think that 2:30 was the optimal time to see the sculpture because the sun was directly behind the sculpture and was at the perfect angle to fill the room with light, but not be so low that it was obscured by the other buildings. The sunlight interacting with the sculpture added many elements to the composition that made the sculpture look waterlike.  </p>

    <p class="tab"> A team charter must be completed by Sunday at midnight that will lay out the expectations and cooperation plans for the rest of the ZMA Project (Harris Cox 1). I think that each team member should keep a journal to keep track of the work they completed, which allows them to be held accountable by the rest of the team if they do not complete their designated work. In my experience, the most efficient way to complete a writing project as a team is through live editing a Word document and GroupMe so that information about progress, meetings, and deadlines, as well as specific comments on assignments can be easily given. Before submitting an assignment, every team member should review the whole assignment so that typos can be fixed and so that there is a consensus that the best decisions are being made. Once feedback is given received for an assignment, I think that the team should review it and take notes. Above all, timely responses and clear communication are the most important for a successful group project.</p>
    <p class="tab"> Most college students have completed many group projects before, but almost none of them are excited when a new group project is announced (Reifenberg). Incongruent expectations for the planning, scope, and pacing of the project can lead students to combine multiple individually completed sections that look inconsistent overall. Therefore, it is important for team members to learn about the knowledge, skills, strengths, and weaknesses of each other before deciding a plan. For example, I have strengths through my experience in art history, anthropology, statistics, and excel spreadsheets, so I could be a good fit for art analysis or large data collection. I also work best when I can get feedback from the group, while others may work best through completing their section of a task individually and placing it into the larger assignment with the team. These are some of the many considerations for the team charter that will help the ZMA Project progress more smoothly.</p>
    <p class="tab"> In the past, there have been times where I have felt that my team was dragged down by a team member that did not effectively communicate and or contribute. I usually gave them the benefit of the doubt because there could be personal circumstances affecting their ability to work. However, in order to get the best quality work submitted by the various deadlines, there is a process to address non-contributing team members. Instead of absorbing the problem caused by a “hitchhiker”, where you take on the extra work they refuse to complete, you mirror the problem by having firm expectations and consequences (Oakley 19-27). Most reasons for not completing work were the decision of the hitchhikers to let it happen, they may be disingenuous in their intentions, and there is just no excuse for not communicating any foreseeable problems with the team or instructor. The best action to take in this situation is to exclude the hitchhiker’s name from the final submission unless they contribute to the project. It is important to lay out firm plans and expectations in the team charter so that any conflicts within the team can be resolved in a timely manner.</p>

    <h2>January 22nd, 2023</h2>
    <p class="tab"> Our class will be creating an audio tour to accompany the Zuckerman Museum of Art walking tour on the KSU campus. The goal of the walking tour is to educate and provide a cultural focus for students and faculty using contemporary art <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1222023">(Halsey and Von Kutzleben)</a>. The first step in this process is to review their website to gain context about the artists and their works for the upcoming tour next Tuesday and to give suggestions on how to improve the website. While the website gave useful information for taking the ZMA tour and context into the varying perspectives of the artists, there are many improvements that can be made to give a more comprehensive and immersive guide to the walking tour. </p>
    <img src="/blog/fdbc047279b5768b3aed0e939d4457995679f1fb.jpg" alt="ZMA" class="center"  width="400" height="400">
    <p class="caption"> The Zuckerman Museum of Art</p>
    <p class="tab"> One suggestion for the website is to improve the consistency in writing throughout the website for descriptions of artists and artworks. In the map tour, some artists are given no description at all, some only have their qualifications listed, and some have the descriptions and context provided to be able to fully interpret their artworks. Only listing qualifications is an insufficient method for preparing students for the walking tour because lists are not engaging and may lose a reader’s attention. Furthermore, they give no information about the artworks themselves and credibility will only be built for the artists if the reader recognizes an institution or exhibition, which is not always the case when there are such long lists. This section stands out as incomplete in comparison to the student garden section, where each student described the choices made in planning out and creating their artworks. The best descriptions of artists and their works were in the artist statements. While it is possible that artist statements could not be retrieved from every artist due to not being able to contact them, it is important for the website and audio tour to include ekphrasis, which is the use of a detailed description to describe art. There are many methods in which this description can be accomplished, such as celebratory or painterly, and in artist statements it allows readers or listeners to gain the artist’s perspective about their work that is based on their life experiences <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1222023">(Lemay)</a>. This will help an audience be able to get into a creative mindset and relate to the message of the art. </p>

    <p class="caption">One example of ekphrasis is describing why a certain artwork caught your eye during a museum visit</p>
    <p class="tab"> The inconsistency on the website can also be seen in its formatting. The website contains some erroneous information such as having sections on works that have been removed from campus such as <em>Spaceship Earth</em>, links that lead to the wrong webpages, or artworks in the wrong artist sections. The website design itself has confusing, cluttered maps, no margins around images that would visually compartmentalize areas of the website, and a small, hard to see widget for the map tour section. These elements may seem pedantic to point out in isolation, but overall, the website, and the audio tour we will eventually create needs to be able to hook an audience in and immerse them in the information being presented, both with its design and writing. Instead of presenting dull lists of information at face value, the information can be connected to overarching themes and narratives, such as at the <em>Getty Villa</em>, which uses the stories in the <em>Percy Jackson</em> book series to guide and engage young audiences <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1222023">(Carlsson)</a>. This works well with the artist statements the artist statements already provided for our tour because we can use the artists’ perspectives to shape the creative design of the website and audio tour.</p>
    <img src="/blog/image.png" alt="percyjackson" class="center"  width="400" height="400">
    <p class="caption">Part of the tour at the <em>Getty Villa</em></p>
    <p class="tab"> In fact, the artist statements were what made the student garden section the most engaging part of the website. For each student, there was consistency in the quality, focus, and clarity of the descriptions of their thought processes, which made me eager to learn more about the artworks and made that section of the website have a good writing pace and flow. This clarity of information and understanding of the art is also important for the curators of the museum and for us when we are creating the art tour because all the art pieces should fit within the mission statement of the ZMA in order to uphold the overall vision of those who create and maintain this art as well as the vision of KSU as a community <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1222023">(Waltheimer 4)</a>. Upholding this responsibility will allow the walking tour to provide a more concise message to audiences and therefore facilitate a stronger educational dialogue.</p>
    <p class="tab"> I believe that the most efficient way to build off the website and walking tour with the audio tour would be to portray the art pieces from the artists’ perspectives using music and ekphrasis. Digital technology could be utilized by scanning QR codes at each piece so that those who are just passing by can quickly save information about the piece and so that the flow of the tour is not broken by people having to crowd around plaques to read them. A way that the audience could be further engaged is through customization of the tour. There could be different cut sections of audio such as a brief outline as opposed to a long, in-depth ekphrasis, depending on how interested an individual is in a certain art piece so that they have control about how much time they spend at each art piece.</p>

    <p class="caption">QR Codes used at an exhibition at the Georgia Museum of Art</p>
    <p class="tab"> In all, while there were parts of the <em>Art on Campus</em> website with both inconsistencies and easy to fix mistakes, there were also many parts of the website that were fun and engaging that can be examined and learned from to both improve the website and create an immersive experience in the audio tour. I am confident that the work that we will do on this project will not only improve our writing skills through ekphrasis, but also create a stronger understanding of how to express art in different media such as narration and music. All these elements and techniques in presenting to an audience will be important to consider when taking notes on the art tour on Tuesday.</p>
