    <h2>January 22nd, 2023</h2>
    <p class="tab"> Our class will be creating an audio tour to accompany the Zuckerman Museum of Art walking tour on the KSU campus. The goal of the walking tour is to educate and provide a cultural focus for students and faculty using contemporary art <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1222023">(Halsey and Von Kutzleben)</a>. The first step in this process is to review their website to gain context about the artists and their works for the upcoming tour next Tuesday and to give suggestions on how to improve the website. While the website gave useful information for taking the ZMA tour and context into the varying perspectives of the artists, there are many improvements that can be made to give a more comprehensive and immersive guide to the walking tour. </p>

    <p class="tab"> One suggestion for the website is to improve the consistency in writing throughout the website for descriptions of artists and artworks. In the map tour, some artists are given no description at all, some only have their qualifications listed, and some have the descriptions and context provided to be able to fully interpret their artworks. Only listing qualifications is an insufficient method for preparing students for the walking tour because lists are not engaging and may lose a reader’s attention. Furthermore, they give no information about the artworks themselves and credibility will only be built for the artists if the reader recognizes an institution or exhibition, which is not always the case when there are such long lists. This section stands out as incomplete in comparison to the student garden section, where each student described the choices made in planning out and creating their artworks. The best descriptions of artists and their works were in the artist statements. While it is possible that artist statements could not be retrieved from every artist due to not being able to contact them, it is important for the website and audio tour to include ekphrasis, which is the use of a detailed description to describe art. There are many methods in which this description can be accomplished, such as celebratory or painterly, and in artist statements it allows readers or listeners to gain the artist’s perspective about their work that is based on their life experiences <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1222023">(Lemay)</a>. This will help an audience be able to get into a creative mindset and relate to the message of the art. </p>

    <p class="caption">One example of ekphrasis is describing why a certain artwork caught your eye during a museum visit</p>
    <p class="tab"> The inconsistency on the website can also be seen in its formatting. The website contains some erroneous information such as having sections on works that have been removed from campus such as <em>Spaceship Earth</em>, links that lead to the wrong webpages, or artworks in the wrong artist sections. The website design itself has confusing, cluttered maps, no margins around images that would visually compartmentalize areas of the website, and a small, hard to see widget for the map tour section. These elements may seem pedantic to point out in isolation, but overall, the website, and the audio tour we will eventually create needs to be able to hook an audience in and immerse them in the information being presented, both with its design and writing. Instead of presenting dull lists of information at face value, the information can be connected to overarching themes and narratives, such as at the <em>Getty Villa</em>, which uses the stories in the <em>Percy Jackson</em> book series to guide and engage young audiences <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1222023">(Carlsson)</a>. This works well with the artist statements the artist statements already provided for our tour because we can use the artists’ perspectives to shape the creative design of the website and audio tour.</p>

    <p class="tab"> In fact, the artist statements were what made the student garden section the most engaging part of the website. For each student, there was consistency in the quality, focus, and clarity of the descriptions of their thought processes, which made me eager to learn more about the artworks and made that section of the website have a good writing pace and flow. This clarity of information and understanding of the art is also important for the curators of the museum and for us when we are creating the art tour because all the art pieces should fit within the mission statement of the ZMA in order to uphold the overall vision of those who create and maintain this art as well as the vision of KSU as a community <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1222023">(Waltheimer 4)</a>. Upholding this responsibility will allow the walking tour to provide a more concise message to audiences and therefore facilitate a stronger educational dialogue.</p>
    <p class="tab"> I believe that the most efficient way to build off the website and walking tour with the audio tour would be to portray the art pieces from the artists’ perspectives using music and ekphrasis. Digital technology could be utilized by scanning QR codes at each piece so that those who are just passing by can quickly save information about the piece and so that the flow of the tour is not broken by people having to crowd around plaques to read them. A way that the audience could be further engaged is through customization of the tour. There could be different cut sections of audio such as a brief outline as opposed to a long, in-depth ekphrasis, depending on how interested an individual is in a certain art piece so that they have control about how much time they spend at each art piece.</p>

    <p class="tab"> In all, while there were parts of the <em>Art on Campus</em> website with both inconsistencies and easy to fix mistakes, there were also many parts of the website that were fun and engaging that can be examined and learned from to both improve the website and create an immersive experience in the audio tour. I am confident that the work that we will do on this project will not only improve our writing skills through ekphrasis, but also create a stronger understanding of how to express art in different media such as narration and music. All these elements and techniques in presenting to an audience will be important to consider when taking notes on the art tour on Tuesday.</p>
