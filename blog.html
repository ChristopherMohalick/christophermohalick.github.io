<p class="sech">Engaging Secondary Sources</p>
<p> In my research essay, I need to make a claim that I can support with evidence. Each source I include should be appropriate to my reasoning and purposeful to the argument I am making, and this can include acknowledging and rebutting counterclaims <a class="link" href="workscited.html#03292023">(The Writing Center)</a>. Organization will be important in writing the research essay because it will need to have clear and consistent reasoning in order to be effective. One organizational method is to use signal phrases when introducing evidence. They will also give credibility and context to sources. The argument in my research essay is that 20th century ideologies have impacted museum design and collections. This argument uses the <b>piggybacking strategy</b> to engage with secondary sources because it agrees with all the sources and synthesizes many events together to draw a conclusion about the broader interaction between 20th century ideology and museums <a class="link" href="workscited.html#03292023">(Gaipa)</a>.</p>
<p class="sech">Ideologies and Time Periods</p>
<p> The sources I collected for my annotated bibliography mostly include information and examples about fascist and communist suppression and transformation of museums. The following lists detail categories that subdivide 20th century ideology. Since my research involves how ideology changes museums, I can use examples of how museums changed during periods of ideological change within a nation. This information about ideology also could be used as the structure of the final research essay.</p>
<p><b>Time Periods:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-WW1 Museums</li>
<li>WW1 Museums</li>
<li>Interwar Museums</li>
<li>WW2 Museums</li>
<li>Cold War Museums</li>
<li>Post Cold War Museums</li>
</ul>
	<p><b>State Ideologies <a class="link" href="workscited.html#03292023">(Kurth 3-8)</a>:</b></p>

	 <p class="sech">Inquiry Question </p>
	<p class="tab">My inquiry question is What was the impact of 20th century political ideologies on museum designs and collections? The 20th century was a time of social upheaval that changed much of the world from monarchies to fascism, communism, and liberalism, to the modern governments today.</p>

	 <p class="sech">Possible Sources</p>
	<p class="tab">I will draw from what I learn from my Intro to Anthropology and Art in Society classes, as well as from materials in this course, to find starting points for research. For example, I learned about Catalhoyuk in my Anthropology course and noticed that it looks like Habitat 67, which is brutalist communal living created in the Soviet Union. This could connect to my research because ideologies like fascism and communism strove for historical or philosophical ideals like how the Nazis imitated the Romans. Furthermore, many art movements challenged the status quo during the 20th century, so I can use my knowledge of them to see how different ideologies and governments made art and architecture using them to send a political message.</p>

  <p class="sech">Inquiry Question Generation</p>
  <p class="tab">I determined last week that I would research something that related to the ZMA Museum, art analysis, and history, since those topics are my interests and were elements that I encountered when contributing to the tour report. This week, I further narrowed down the scope of my research. I chose the topic of <b> the cultural and architectural history of museums and museum designs</b>. This topic allows me to utilize what I learned about museums and how they function from the first half of the ZMA project along with my skills in art analysis and knowledge of history. From this topic, I generated the following questions that have varying levels of relation to it:</p>
<p><b>Direct (100% related)</b>
<ul>
<li>Who were influential designers in the High Museum, Guggenheim, and other postmodern museums?</li>
<li>What was the first museum?</li>
<li>What percentage of museums are designed for specific art movements?</li>
<li>What is the influence of political ideology on museum design?</li>
<li>What is the influence of the Renaissance and Enlightenment Era on the creation of museums?</li>
<li>Did the Romans or Ancient Greeks have museums?</li>
<li>Do reliquaries and the churches that hold them count as museums?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Indirect (50% related)</b>
<ul>
<li>What are the cultural perceptions of museums?</li>
<li>What is the influence of art movements on museum design?</li>
<li>What are the influences of war and censorship on the function of museums?</li>
<li>What are some of the more obscure cultures or religions that have museums?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Oblique (10% related)</b>
<ul>
<li>What makes a culture value an object above others?</li>
<li>What makes an object culturally significant or divine?</li>
<li>Do religious or secular institutions value material relics more?</li>
<li>What is the philosophy of why humans see themselves or their personalities through the objects they own?</li>
</ul>
</p>	
	 <p class="tab">The next step is to narrow down the topic into an inquiry question, which allows for more concise claims to be made and makes the research process easier. A concise inquiry question can be turned into many combinations of <b>keywords</b>, which are groups of words and phrases that can be used in search engines and databases to find the top sources relating to an inquiry question, facilitating a faster filtering through potential sources out of the potentially endless results that the internet or a database can provide <a class="link" href="workscited.html#03152023">(Ballenger 42)</a>. I want to create a relationship inquiry question because it is the most descriptive type of question and searches for a correlation or causation between two things <a class="link" href="workscited.html#03152023">(Ballenger 35)</a>. I will keep in mind that in the final paper, the inquiry question will be presented as a thesis and that my sources will be dispersed throughout my entire argument to support my line of reasoning in answering the inquiry. Furthermore, the keywords I chose to research could affect the biases that affect my claims and the lense through which the inquiry is conducted, so it is important to reflect on the scope and effectiveness of my writing as I progress <a class="link" href="workscited.html#03152023">(Everett 1-4)</a>. Specific events or topics that I could utilize for my inquiry question include: 
<ul>
  <li>Historical Precursors and Origins of Museums</li>
  <li>History of the Etowah Mounds State Historic Site</li>
  <li>The correlation between reliquaries, aristocracy, and the creation of museums</li>
<li> The impact of the Age of Enlightenment on the creation of Museums </li>
<li> The impact of 20th century ideology on museum design </li>
</ul>

  <p class="tab">On Tuesday, the class finished the ZMA Tour Report. The next assignment will be an individual research essay that relates to the ZMA project. It will take an inquiry-based approach, which means that research will start with a question rather than a hypothesis. This assignment will be evaluated based on its organization, focus, and engagement and attention given to intellectual works, genre, analysis, and persuasion <a class="link" href="workscited.html#03012023">(Harris Cox)</a>. </p>
  <p class="tab">Primary and secondary sources must be used to support answers to the research inquiry. Primary sources are direct evidence of a topic including observational studies, experiments, academic and legal documentation, creative writing, and formal visual analysis. Secondary sources are evidence that summarize, analyze, and interpret primary sources, which include newspapers, magazines, books, website articles, and academic journal articles that respond or rebuke other work <a class="link" href="workscited.html#03012023">(Ithaca College Library)</a>.</p>
  <p class="tab">I am interested in taking this project into the direction of art analysis and history. Rigorous research writing depends on resourcefulness and creativity in managing and exploiting the seven kinds of archives: paper, living, electronic, visual, audio, experiential, and memory and imagination <a class="link" href="workscited.html#03012023">(Gerard 2-5)</a>. My initial ideas are exploring the connections of the ZMA art to art history, such as <em>Marking Time</em> by Beth Lilly and religious practices, <em>Quetzal</em> by Robert T. Witherspoon and Mesoamerican art and tradition, and <em>Vandauga</em> by Ric Snead and Gothic stained glass and the religious concept of divine light <a class="link" href="workscited.html#03012023">(Halsey and Kutzleben)</a>. The initial topics would require me to use primary evidence such as formal analysis of ZMA art, formal analysis of other museum art, written historical records, and artist statements. I would utilize secondary sources that analyze and interpret the art and the written records. Since I roughly know what area I would like to work in, I can build an interest inventory and concept map on these topics and then search for inquiries using the internet and databases <a class="link" href="workscited.html#03012023">(Ballenger 19-26)</a>.</p>
   <p class="tab">I came up with two questions for the upcoming assignment. How will the rigor of revision and development of early drafts be tracked for evaluation? The revision process seems to be a large component of the evaluation, so will students have to submit progress reports or drafts for the essay? What are the guidelines for picking inquiry questions that relate to the ZMA project? How rigorous or in-depth do they have to be? In past inquiry research I have done, my research question was the core element and starting point for the project, so it was essential that it was clear, concise, and covered a research gap. I am wondering how broad or narrow the research is allowed to be.</p>

  <p class="sech">Writing the Tour Report Draft</p>
   <p class="tab">Over the past week, having toured the walking tour and ZMA indoor gallery as well as asking questions to the ZMA outreach coordinator, the class has thought up a list of topics for positive comments and constructive feedback about the <a class="link" href="workscited.html#02162023"><em>Art on Campus</em></a> website and the walking tour. We then designated each topic to a student to write about. We had to write in memo format, which means that there are different formatting rules such as a heading that specifies who it is from and who it is to, an introduction, section headings, and single-spaced text with no indentation <a class="link" href="workscited.html#02162023">(Purdue Online Writing Lab)</a>. The three sections for the memo are Context for the Campus Art Tour Review: What We’re Doing, Suggestions for Website Revisions: What Could Work, and Recommendations for Tour Revisions: What Would They Like. The topics I wrote about were website formatting and how to implement the QR codes. One important takeaway I found is that it will be important to suggest redesigns to the website that will be compatible with the QR codes, such as through separate web pages and consistent formatting, so that the audience can efficiently learn as they move from artwork to artwork.</p>

  <p class="sech">Tour Report Decisions</p>
   <p class="tab">One of the conflicts over the decisions that need to be made in the tour report is the long, scrolling main webpage on the <em>Art on Campus</em> website. Some complaints were that the website is not mobile-friendly and that continuous scrolling would be annoying for mobile users. For the QR codes that will be placed along the walking tour for each art piece, they will either need to be digitally bookmarked so that the website redirects to a certain part of the page, which may or may not be within the technological capacity of StoryMaps, or the website needs to be redesigned so that each QR code can link to a separate page. If separate pages were made for each art piece, it would be much more work for whoever is designing the website, as there are issues with linking to different webpages on the current website. Audio recordings can also be linked in <a class="link"href="workscited.html#02162023"><em>StoryMaps</em></a> StoryMaps to each art piece. Other elements of the website may not need to be overhauled or scrapped, but reworked. The maps are good for helping users understand the walking tour locations, but they are currently designed in a confusing and cluttered manner. The navigation bar is helpful in knowing the location of a section in the website, but it could be simplified by not naming every artist. Some pictures may not be of the highest quality and should be retaken. For the walking tour itself, the class needs to decide if the order of the artworks needs to be changed or if artworks need to be removed from the tour so that it is a more efficient and timely experience.</p>

  <p class="sech">Team Roles in Editing and Research</p>
   <p class="tab">This week, every team was assigned research and revising topics for the tour report. My team was assigned to research accessibility policies at KSU and to revise the topics we wrote about, which were the QR codes, the tour walking paths, and artwork upkeep. Over the next week, we will revise our part of the memo by editing for conciseness and decision consistency, add examples and evidence with in-text citations, add bullet points and bold text to make the memo more readable, and add tables, maps, and pictures. I think that we create a map that shows the best possible walking path based on our research, and my section on implementing the QR codes will have to be revised as decisions are made on how the website will be designed.</p>

  <p class="sech">McMaster Campus Sculpture Tour</p>
   <p class="tab">I listened to the <a class="link"href="workscited.html#02162023">McMaster Campus Sculpture audio tour</a>. This audio tour is much more helpful in comparing it to the work our class will have to do because the artwork is at the McMaster University Campus. The audio tour uses an interactive map that is very similar to the one on the <em>Art on Campus</em> website. This shows that it may be best for the map to be kept for the important information it tells but it should be reformatted for better readability. The audio tour map uses Google Maps, so that could be an alternative if the map on the website cannot be sufficiently improved. All of the voice actors project their voice well and have engaging intonation. The way they speak is a great improvement to an audio tour over a monotone or robotic voice, so we may want to mention in the tour report the importance of finding good voice actors.</p>

  <p class="sech">Social Capital and Walking Tour Revisions</p>
   <p class="tab">Museum theorists think that museums create social capital to reinforce the health and democratic processes of a society. Social capital is built through shared experiences that facilitate trust, cooperation, and action <a class="link" href="workscited.html#02162023">(Silverman 19)</a>. Contemporary art installations often aim to create social capital by making audiences consider their relationship to themselves, the art, the artist, their community, and their society. The tour report should include a section suggesting to make the pebbles on <em>Marking Time</em> by Beth Lilly free because you cannot fully consider your relationship to the art and get meaning from the artwork without interacting with it. For example, when my team sat on the <em>Recess Swing</em> by Didi Dunphy, it made us realize that the swing had oversized proportions to make the audience feel as small as a child. The purpose of the art installation and the reason it is the first artwork on the tour is to memorialize the collaboration from both artists and audiences needed to make museum experiences. Other art pieces on the tour such as <em>Vandauga</em> by Ric Snead, which includes the sunlight coming through the windows as part of the installation, use nature to make the audience consider their relationship to their environment. Overall, I think that the intended interaction between the audience and the art is an important factor to consider when recommending changes to the walking tour.</p>

   <div class="content">
    <p class="tab">On Tuesday, we met with the outreach coordinator Elizabeth Thomas to take a tour of the art in the ZMA building and ask questions about the project. We learned that the <em>Art on Campus</em> website was created by two Geography students and that they were limited by the website template in their design because of the website guidelines laid out by the school. In regards to the walking tour we took last Tuesday, we learned that the <em>Spaceship Earth</em> has been permanently removed for being too unstable and that the placement of the artworks around campus were considered individually as opposed to being grouped into themes. The scope of what can be created in the audio tour is that we can use the artists’ statements provided on the website and attempt to contact the artists to fill in any missing information or artist statements, but we cannot include any unapproved interpretations because we are not qualified to do so. Furthermore, it is feasible to use music throughout the audio tour because we could ask to use music owned by the Bailey School of Music. The outreach coordinator also said that the ZMA would like the audio tour to be accessed by scanning QR codes at each plaque on the walking tour, so each artwork would have a separate recording instead of one continuous recording. This information greatly narrows down what information about the art we have to work with as well as what resources we have to create an immersive experience and now the class can construct a much more tangible plan for the rest of the project.</p>
	  <img src="/blog/music-banner.jpg" alt="HTML" class="center">
    <p class="caption"> Students from the Bailey School of Music in the Zuckerman Museum of Art</p>
    <p class="tab">In its mission statement, the ZMA states that it aims to create a community of artists, scholars, and professionals that encourage critical thinking, spark educational dialogue, and teach about contemporary artistic trends, historical approaches to artistic production, and artistic diversity, all while integrating technological innovation <a class="link" href="workscited.html#2012023">(Bernard A. Zuckerman Museum of Art)</a>. For the audio tour, therefore, it will be important to emphasize both the perspectives of historical art production and novel, modern trends in art and the diversity of work that is being created. We also should use the technology we have available for the audio tour such as QR codes, web design, and sound design.</p>

    <p class="caption">Portrait of Bernard A. Zuckerman</p>
    <p class="tab"> One way that we could narrate the audio tour is through a historical lens. For example, the Vatican Museum in Rome gives a formal analysis of the artwork, the historical and mythological context for the artwork and their artists, and then chronologically explains if they have changed since then <a class="link" href="workscited.html#2012023">(Musei Vatecani)</a>. This gives an organized presentation of all the information needed to interpret the art, but it provides no narrative. In order to make the tour as memorable as possible, the audio tour should connect the art to the personal experiences and emotions of the audience, which engages them so that they can absorb the deeper meaning of the art and synthesize it into their own lives <a class="link" href="workscited.html#2012023">(Bedford 58-61)</a>. This means that the audio tour should not necessarily be guided by giving the audience a interactive choice of how and when to view the art, but by a detailed, strong narrative that appeals to universal values. The artist statements that we could use would put audiences into the mindsets of the artist so that they can not only marvel at the technique of the art, but use what they learned and what they know about themselves to craft their own interpretations. </p>

    <p class="tab"> On Tuesday, we split up into teams to take notes about the ZMA walking tour and gain more information about the artworks in-person. There were many unexpected discoveries because the way that you interact with the sculptures and how they interact with the environment can only be seen in-person, which reinforces the enhanced experience a walking tour provides over a digital experience. </p>
    <p class="tab"> The <em>Marking Time</em> sculpture is meant to be a cairn, which is a pile of stones that act as a marker or burial monument. A possible reason that this sculpture is the first on the tour is that cairns act as markers that tell travelers they are going in the right direction. By taking a seat on the <em>Recess Swing</em>, I discovered that the swing is much larger than a normal swing, which makes one feel like they are the size of a child again when they sit in it. <em>Vandauga</em> was very difficult to find, and my team went into many buildings until we finally found it in the Wilson Annex. I think that 2:30 was the optimal time to see the sculpture because the sun was directly behind the sculpture and was at the perfect angle to fill the room with light, but not be so low that it was obscured by the other buildings. The sunlight interacting with the sculpture added many elements to the composition that made the sculpture look waterlike.  </p>

    <p class="tab"> A team charter must be completed by Sunday at midnight that will lay out the expectations and cooperation plans for the rest of the ZMA Project <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1252023">(Harris Cox 1)</a>. I think that each team member should keep a journal to keep track of the work they completed, which allows them to be held accountable by the rest of the team if they do not complete their designated work. In my experience, the most efficient way to complete a writing project as a team is through live editing a Word document and GroupMe so that information about progress, meetings, and deadlines, as well as specific comments on assignments can be easily given. Before submitting an assignment, every team member should review the whole assignment so that typos can be fixed and so that there is a consensus that the best decisions are being made. Once feedback is given received for an assignment, I think that the team should review it and take notes. Above all, timely responses and clear communication are the most important for a successful group project.</p>
    <p class="tab"> Most college students have completed many group projects before, but almost none of them are excited when a new group project is announced <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1252023">(Reifenberg)</a>. Incongruent expectations for the planning, scope, and pacing of the project can lead students to combine multiple individually completed sections that look inconsistent overall. Therefore, it is important for team members to learn about the knowledge, skills, strengths, and weaknesses of each other before deciding a plan. For example, I have strengths through my experience in art history, anthropology, statistics, and excel spreadsheets, so I could be a good fit for art analysis or large data collection. I also work best when I can get feedback from the group, while others may work best through completing their section of a task individually and placing it into the larger assignment with the team. These are some of the many considerations for the team charter that will help the ZMA Project progress more smoothly.</p>
    <p class="tab"> In the past, there have been times where I have felt that my team was dragged down by a team member that did not effectively communicate and or contribute. I usually gave them the benefit of the doubt because there could be personal circumstances affecting their ability to work. However, in order to get the best quality work submitted by the various deadlines, there is a process to address non-contributing team members. Instead of absorbing the problem caused by a “hitchhiker”, where you take on the extra work they refuse to complete, you mirror the problem by having firm expectations and consequences <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1252023">(Oakley 19-27)</a>. Most reasons for not completing work were the decision of the hitchhikers to let it happen, they may be disingenuous in their intentions, and there is just no excuse for not communicating any foreseeable problems with the team or instructor. The best action to take in this situation is to exclude the hitchhiker’s name from the final submission unless they contribute to the project. It is important to lay out firm plans and expectations in the team charter so that any conflicts within the team can be resolved in a timely manner.</p>

    <p class="tab"> One suggestion for the website is to improve the consistency in writing throughout the website for descriptions of artists and artworks. In the map tour, some artists are given no description at all, some only have their qualifications listed, and some have the descriptions and context provided to be able to fully interpret their artworks. Only listing qualifications is an insufficient method for preparing students for the walking tour because lists are not engaging and may lose a reader’s attention. Furthermore, they give no information about the artworks themselves and credibility will only be built for the artists if the reader recognizes an institution or exhibition, which is not always the case when there are such long lists. This section stands out as incomplete in comparison to the student garden section, where each student described the choices made in planning out and creating their artworks. The best descriptions of artists and their works were in the artist statements. While it is possible that artist statements could not be retrieved from every artist due to not being able to contact them, it is important for the website and audio tour to include ekphrasis, which is the use of a detailed description to describe art. There are many methods in which this description can be accomplished, such as celebratory or painterly, and in artist statements it allows readers or listeners to gain the artist’s perspective about their work that is based on their life experiences <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1222023">(Lemay)</a>. This will help an audience be able to get into a creative mindset and relate to the message of the art. </p>

    <p class="tab"> The inconsistency on the website can also be seen in its formatting. The website contains some erroneous information such as having sections on works that have been removed from campus such as <em>Spaceship Earth</em>, links that lead to the wrong webpages, or artworks in the wrong artist sections. The website design itself has confusing, cluttered maps, no margins around images that would visually compartmentalize areas of the website, and a small, hard to see widget for the map tour section. These elements may seem pedantic to point out in isolation, but overall, the website, and the audio tour we will eventually create needs to be able to hook an audience in and immerse them in the information being presented, both with its design and writing. Instead of presenting dull lists of information at face value, the information can be connected to overarching themes and narratives, such as at the <em>Getty Villa</em>, which uses the stories in the <em>Percy Jackson</em> book series to guide and engage young audiences <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1222023">(Carlsson)</a>. This works well with the artist statements the artist statements already provided for our tour because we can use the artists’ perspectives to shape the creative design of the website and audio tour.</p>

    <p class="tab"> In fact, the artist statements were what made the student garden section the most engaging part of the website. For each student, there was consistency in the quality, focus, and clarity of the descriptions of their thought processes, which made me eager to learn more about the artworks and made that section of the website have a good writing pace and flow. This clarity of information and understanding of the art is also important for the curators of the museum and for us when we are creating the art tour because all the art pieces should fit within the mission statement of the ZMA in order to uphold the overall vision of those who create and maintain this art as well as the vision of KSU as a community <a class="link" href="workscited.html#1222023">(Waltheimer 4)</a>. Upholding this responsibility will allow the walking tour to provide a more concise message to audiences and therefore facilitate a stronger educational dialogue.</p>
    <p class="tab"> I believe that the most efficient way to build off the website and walking tour with the audio tour would be to portray the art pieces from the artists’ perspectives using music and ekphrasis. Digital technology could be utilized by scanning QR codes at each piece so that those who are just passing by can quickly save information about the piece and so that the flow of the tour is not broken by people having to crowd around plaques to read them. A way that the audience could be further engaged is through customization of the tour. There could be different cut sections of audio such as a brief outline as opposed to a long, in-depth ekphrasis, depending on how interested an individual is in a certain art piece so that they have control about how much time they spend at each art piece.</p>

    <p class="tab"> In all, while there were parts of the <em>Art on Campus</em> website with both inconsistencies and easy to fix mistakes, there were also many parts of the website that were fun and engaging that can be examined and learned from to both improve the website and create an immersive experience in the audio tour. I am confident that the work that we will do on this project will not only improve our writing skills through ekphrasis, but also create a stronger understanding of how to express art in different media such as narration and music. All these elements and techniques in presenting to an audience will be important to consider when taking notes on the art tour on Tuesday.</p>
